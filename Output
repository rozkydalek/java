/*******************************************************************************
 * 
 * The {@code Output} class instances represent the demonstration
 * of a Java program with four classes named Shape, Sphere, Pyramid and Output.  
 * 
 * The Shape class is a superclass and both classes Sphere and Pyramid are 
 * subclasses of the class Shape.  The main method is located 
 * in the class Output. The output is to be displayed in the console.
 * 
 * The superclass Shape is an abstract class (particularly, abstract interface)
 * with the following two abstract methods:
 *
 *  calcVolume();
 *  calcSurfaceArea(); 
 * 
 * The subclasses do override these abstract methods. 
 * 
 * The subclass Sphere has the following data members:
 * 
 * radius
 * PI (π = 3.14159)
 * 
 * and the methods calcVolume() and calcSurfaceArea() which override 
 * the abstract methods in the Shape superclass.
 * 
 * The volume is calculated as (4 / 3) * PI * radius * radius * radius,
 * and the surface area is 4 * PI * radius * radius
 * 
 * The subclass Pyramid (representing a structure like those in Egypt) 
 * has the following members:
 * 
 * base
 * height
 * 
 * The volume is calculated as base * base * height / 3,
 * and the surface area is 4 * base * sqrt((height * height) + (base * base / 4)) / 2,
 * and the Java function used to calculate the square root of a number is Math.sqrt( )
 * 
 * The program creates two objects in class Output.  
 * One object is instantiated from the class Sphere and the second object 
 * from the class Pyramid. The Sphere object has a radius of 10.  
 * The Cylinder object has a base of 230 and a height of 140  
 * 
 * The program outputs the input data, the surface area and volume for both objects
 * as follows:
 * 
 * Radius of the sphere is 10.0 units.
 * Base of the Pyramid is 230.0
 * and it's height is 140.0 units.
 * Surface of the sphere is 1256.636 square units
 * and volume of the sphere is 3141.59 cubic units.
 * Surface of the pyramid is 166682.57257433963 square units
 * and volume of the pyramid is 2468666.6666666665 cubic units.
